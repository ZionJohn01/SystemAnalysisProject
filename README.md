# SystemAnalysisProject

The DriverPass project was a product to be designed and created for DriverPass. They wished to improve their service by possessing an online application in which clients can reserve driving lessons. The system we wanted to design was a web application that tracked statistics and would be available offline.

I feel that I composed some interesting cases for this project. In designing a project like this it is important to think of every user case that you possibly can and then account for it. I was able to predict a useful case that could then be accounted for.

If I could choose one thing to improve about my documents it would be the visual representation of the system. Looking back on the diagrams I don't feel they are as crystal clear as they could have been. With some practice with the program I feel I could improve the overall clarity.

The user's needs are vital when designing a project like this. The project is meant to improve the experience of the user by computerizing the process and if it becomes more frustrating then we have failed. When considering the user's needs it is a bit like chess in that you have to predict what the user might do before they do it.

So far, I have mostly only worked in code. As I dive deeper into the computer science program I find more topics becoming unrelated to coding. Usually when coding I would write up some pseudocode so that I would have a guide and general idea of how to approach the problem. I believe creating requirements and diagrams is a similar way to approach when working with system architecture.
